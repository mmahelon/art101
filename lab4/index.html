		<h1 class="header">Challenges</h1>
		<p>One of our challenges was trying to figure out why the nav-bar and classname wouldn't update to how we styled them in CSS.  </p>
	</div>

<br/>
	<div class= "col-two">
		<h1 class="header">Problems</h1>
		<p>Our biggest problem was formatting, our pseudocode had stange indentation, and we attribute that to a margin issue.  We think that code from the main site may have been messing it up.  </p>
	</div>
	<br>

	<div class = "col-three">
		<h1 class="header">Results:</h1>
		<p>We figured out that the nav-bar and classname issue was happening because we were missing the "=" between the class and name.  The margin issue happened because the code tag reflects all formatting directly from the text editor.
		But besides those little issues, I think our website turned out great!
