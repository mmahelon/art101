	<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
	<p>For this lab I learned how to make and organize local file structures, and how to create index.html files in my computuer.
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>This assignment wasn't too challenging, the organizing of local file structures made alot of sense.  I had a slow start at first- I needed to reference W3 schools to remember some of the basics of HTML.  But I definitely feel more comfortable now.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
